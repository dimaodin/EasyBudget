My goal is give you the knowledge to create a Flutter app entirely from scratch, how to go further and learn more about how to design user interfaces for Flutter apps.

## Installation
At the root of the project run
```
$> flutter install
```
>  aka the needed dependencies.

## Commands
To Run the project
```
$> flutter run
```
